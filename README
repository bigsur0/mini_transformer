Create a ruby gem that uses the nokogiri gem
(https://github.com/tenderlove/nokogiri) to convert the data in
  'input/input.xml'
  'input/input.json'
into the 'output/TP40010215.html' file.

Provide as close to full unit test coverage as you reasonably can.

Make the mappings configurable so that we can easily change the
class used for key labels, for example. The intent is that someone
other than  a ruby programmer (e.g. a designer) will make most of
the changes to the mappings.



Setup:
  Get the code:
    git clone git://github.com/r6p/mini_transformer.git
  
  Setup Ruby and Gemset:
    rvm install ruby-1.9.2 (with rubygems 1.8.10)
    rvm gemset create mini_transformer
    source .rvmrc
  
  Install gems:
    gem install bundler
    bundle install --local
    
  Run MiniTest specs:
    rake spec

Usage:

MiniTransformer::Run.on_dir (
                 :work_dir  =>  "data",
                 :metadata  =>  "input.json",
                 :input     =>  "input.xml",
                 :template  =>  "book.html.erb",
                 :mappings  =>  "book-mappings.yml",
                 :output    =>  "book.html"
               )

TODO:
-use markdown in README
-use file classes to construct OS independent file path
-encoding support, ie input encoding should probably dictate output encoding

Dependencies:
-Nokogiri in Mapper and Input classes
-JSON in Mapper class
-File in Output and Run classes
